Please share your stories about Caddy and auth plugins!

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the
[`blog/`](https://github.com/authcrunch/authcrunch.github.io/new/main/blog/)
directory.

Additionally, add yourself to blog authors via
[`authors.yml`](https://github.com/authcrunch/authcrunch.github.io/edit/main/blog/authors.yml).

If your blog post has images, then create a folder for the post
and co-locate images with the post itself.

- `2021-10-31-mypost/index.md`
- `2021-10-31-mypost/image1.jpeg`

Include the image in the `.md` file with the following snippet:

```
![Image for my post](./image1.jpeg)
```

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2021-10-31-welcome.md`
- `2021-10-31-welcome/index.md`
